## Course description

This is a hands-on course that introduces students to the use of digital tools
and sources to conduct original historical research, analyze and interpret
findings, and communicate results. Digital history is an interdisciplinary
approach that seeks to bring digital technology into conversation with
humanities disciplines and, specifically, seeks to analyze, synthesize, and
present knowledge through computational media. Digital historians create  
digital archival collections, databases, digitize objects, analyze humanistic
material in digital form, and addresses scholarly questions often difficult, if not
impossible, to ask using non-computational methods.

In this course you will apply digital methods to an historical question and
produce a final, public project. We will also have a series of guests joining us for the course, all
scholars in digital humanities, whose work is helping shape the field. You
will have an opportunity to engage with these scholars and the methodologies,
theories, questions, and works they are producing.

In order to keep our efforts focused, we will apply what we learn to a
particular area of historical study: the history of Silicon Valley. We all
live in this place, and we should seek to understand something about the place
in which we all live, work, and play. The Santa Clara Valley has undergone
dramatic environmental, urban, rural, political, social, and economic change
through the process of conservation and preservation, environmentalism, urban
sprawl, postindustrial growth, mining and timbering industries, and Cold War
defense research. We will examine the twentieth century history of the Santa
Clara Valley and attempt to understand its relationship to the region, to the
American West, to the nation, and to the world.

The core result of this class is a digital history project: you will work with
historical data to form an original research question and, using the tools
introduced throughout the course, will leverage a method towards
answering that question. In the third week of the course, you will be
randomly assigned a team of collaborators. For the remainder of the quarter,
you and your team will work together with a single tool and original
research you conduct in order to create a *beta* version of a digital history
project. We will present the results of your work in an electronic poster
session and the end of the quarter.

## Course goals

Students in this course will:

1. Gain an introductory technical knowledge of many digital tools or methods
   that can be useful to historians and an in-depth knowledge of one or two.
2. Read existing scholarship on a contested historical subject and formulate
   historiographical questions on their own.
3. Learn to apply technical knowledge about digital tools to a substantive and
   complex historical question.
4. Create a public-facing digital project that illustrates the promise and
   limitations of digital historical methods.

## What to expect

This course will feel different from your usual history course. First, rather
than just learning the content of the course, you will be asked to apply your
knowledge to create things. Not all of these will be determined on the first
day of the course. You will have a large responsibility for the final product(s).

Second, to attain the technical skills necessary to create things, you may be
asked to inform and educate yourself outside of class using extracurricular
resources. Be prepared for a lot of DIY throughout the quarter, but you can also
expect help. You won't be going at this alone. Your classmates are collaborators and in that role they may be asked to
help you figure out assignment-related problems, evaluate your work, and share
the workload. You should do the same in return. And come talk with me early and
often!

Finally, much of the work for the course will be done in public on the course
blog and on sites like Twitter (if you're sharing thoughts on Twitter, use the hashtag [#hist205f](https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=%23hist205f)!).
While your grades and evaluations will remain
private, you will share your work with students elsewhere and with the public at
large.

The course is asking you to do things not normally expected in a history
course, where often the emphasis is on individual reading, research, and
writing. The course will be much more informal, and
you can expect that we might change assignments for the course as we go
depending on where our discussions and interests take us. Your
engagement and participation will be essential to the course's success. The historical and computational methods in this course are best
learned by combining them with the readings, writing, and experimentation we
will be doing in the course.

## Evaluation

Assignments in the course will receive these weights. For collaborative work,
your grade will be determined both by your individual contribution and by the
overall quality of the project.

  assignment                weight
  -----------------------   -------
  digital research project  40%
  presentation of project   10%
  readings and discussions  30%
  book review               10%
  blogging                  10%

## Assignments

### Blogging

At the end of each week, complete a blog post on the week's readings and exercises to the course blog. You will complete six of these over the course of the quarter. I expect
more than just a summary of the readings. Think about the kinds of questions
they raised for you, the themes and issues that emerged across the readings,
and how those readings might relate to the previous week's readings. During some weeks you'll also have **homework exercises** that get you hands-on with a tool. If that's the case, your post should put the readings in conversation with the tool(s) used during the week. Blog
posts are due by **Saturday at midnight**.

### Discussion questions

Each week we have readings, you will be required to submit a set of at least three discussion
questions based on the readings that address the topics and themes of the
readings. Discussion questions should be posted to the course blog and will be due
by **midnight on the Sunday before class**.

### Class participation

Come to class prepared to discuss the texts and share ideas about the readings
and digital tools or methods you worked with over the course of the week.  
Participation points are determined by your contribution to the discussion, in
addition to the discussion questions you submit to CourseWork.  Doing careful
readings of the texts, raising questions about what you've read, and
contributing thoughtfully to class discussion will ensure success.

### Presentations

In Week 8 and Week 9 you will be presenting on your research. In Week 8 you
will present to the class your progress on your digital project. In Week 9 we
will hold a public electronic poster session on our digital projects in the Wallenberg Learning Theater.

### Book review

You will be required to acquire one book from the list below and write a three
page book review. Remember that this is not a summary of the text. Rather, you
will engage with the ideas, arguments, themes, and interpretation offered by
the author(s). The book review can be submitted **at any time in the quarter**
and **can be resubmitted as often as you would like** if you are not happy with
the grade you are given. The final book review, however, is absolutely due on
**November 24**.

### Digital history project

The core of the course will be an original digital history project. You will
complete a historical analysis using digital methods we cover in the course
and can approach the history of Silicon Valley in many ways. Perhaps your
group is interested in creating an interactive map of historical technology
companies in order to understand the growth of industry in the Bay Area. Maybe
you are interested in analyzing the text of the *Palo Alto Times* in order to
understand how the newspaper discussed high technology industrialization over
time. You might be interested in creating an interactive exhibit using
photographs, video, and text that explains some element of Silicon Valley's
history. Maybe you're interested in the public history of Stanford and want to
explore why certain buildings are named after people important in the history
of Silicon Valley and the role they played in the Valley's history. The topic
of the research is up to you. We will be examining many entry-level tools in
this course that will lend themselves to historical research, and your
projects will explore both the history of Silicon Valley as well as testing
the digital method's usefulness to offering new perspectives and explanations.

The final project should be substantial and engage with both the history and
the methods learned in the course. The project can be limited to a single
method -- perhaps mapping is the best approach, for example -- but should
engage with the historical material in a significant way. If your project
tends to focus on a particular person, for example, don't just recount the
person's life. Thoughtfully examine their contribution to the history of
Silicon Valley, analyze and interpret the historical evidence, and draw
conclusions. The final project is due at the electronic poster session on **December 1**.
